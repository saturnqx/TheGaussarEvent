        description = First thought to be a passing asteroid, astronomers didnt take much care into looking into it. That was, until they looked a few months later and it was still there. After some analysis, its believed to be a remnant of Kerbins core when an impact caused material to be ejected far from Kerbin, creating the Mun and Minmus.
