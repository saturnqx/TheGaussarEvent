        description = Kerbals kept trying to look at Moho, and wondering if they had dirt on their telescopes from the secondary dot next to Moho. After a while, someone finally decided to just write down where it was located, and after much troubleshooting (and telescope wiping) the moon was finally found to be real.\n\nIt's believed that Geep formed alongside Moho, and may have thrown some asteroids into it, thus causing the giant craters we see now. It's surface is also slightly bleached from proximity to Kerbol, so they are no longer matching colors.
