        description = First spotted during a Kerbol eclipse as a tiny dot to the left of The Mun. At first scientists thought it was just Eve, but after more tracking it was found to be its own body inbetween Kerbin and Eve. Its extremely Oblate, and spins fast. Its also believed to be made of dust and gravel, so its barely holding itself together.
